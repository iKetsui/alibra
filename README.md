# WORK IN PROGRESS 
Since i hate messy folders that flutter does i only keep track of lib folder.

if you would like to test things yourself kindly add all repo files into `lib/` folder by initilizing flutter project manually.

then execute `flutter build apk` to generate the apk, or just launch it via virtual device through vscode's provided plugins 

this will be temporary till i release a stable version of the application
