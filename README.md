# WORK IN PROGRESS 
## E-Reader application for android with customizable library

Since i hate messy folders that flutter does i only keep track of lib folder.

if you would like to test things yourself kindly add all repo files into `lib/` folder by initilizing flutter project manually.

then execute `flutter build apk` to generate the apk, or just launch it via virtual device through vscode's provided plugins 

this will be temporary till i release a stable version of the application 


## checklist features

    - add multiple file selector 
    - add a library list to save the books
    - add customizable tags
    - add sort modes ( size-date-tag only)
